# React Router v6 Path Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: incorrect route rendering due to problems with the `path` prop in `<Route>` components.

## Problem

In React Router v6, the `path` prop in `<Route>` components is crucial for defining the URL path to which a specific component should be rendered.  Omitting the `path` or using an incorrect path leads to unexpected behavior, including:

- Routes not rendering at all.
- Routes rendering on the wrong URLs.

The example demonstrates a simple application with a `Home` and `About` route. The issue highlights the importance of correctly specifying paths in your route definitions.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring each `<Route>` component has a correctly specified `path` prop. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected code.
