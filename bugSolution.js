```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ...more routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return <div>Home</div>;
}

function About() {
  return <div>About</div>;
}
export default App;
```
The solution simply ensures every route has a defined path.  This is a fundamental change from earlier versions of React Router where the default path behavior was different.  This is the corrected version for React Router v6. Always ensure that paths are explicitly and correctly set for each route to avoid rendering issues.
